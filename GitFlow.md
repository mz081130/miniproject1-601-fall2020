##What is Version Control System (VCS)?

Suppose you are a developer and want to keep every version of code or after some particular tasks completion a Version Control System (VCS) is very useful tool. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, compare changes over time, it allow you to take the other developer code changes using git command, see who modified the files over the time, who has done more number of lines of code, various type of statistics on the repository, who has done the code with bug and when, and many more, basically you can entirely do the tracking of the files over the time and go back to any previous changes.
